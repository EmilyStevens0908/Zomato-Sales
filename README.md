Part 1: Focus Area

  Decide which area of focus that you want to concentrate on (there were 3 options: customer analysis segmentation, restaurant analysis, or the one that I chose, sales analysis).
  Write a decomposition based on the area of focus.
  
   Criteria for Decomposition:

    The decomposition should include a detailed and structured research plan. 
    What questions do you want to answer with your dashboard? 
    What hypotheses do you have? 
    What visualizations will be used? 
    How do you need to work with data prior assembling the dashboard?
    All steps in the plan should relate to the research area. 

  Part 2: Testing the Hypothesis

  Find the answers to your hypothesis and questions in Part 1. Create a dashboard for those findings. 

  Criteria for the Dashboard:

    There are no limitations or requirements for your dashboard—except one: it has to be relevant to your research area.
    You may use either Tableau Public or Power BI to create your dashboard. If you need any help with your plan or visualization, you can reach out to your team leader or peers.
    The dashboard should tell a story and every visualization should be a part of this story.

  Part 3: Submission

  Submit your findings.

  Criteria for Report:

    You should provide your findings from working with the data and creating a dashboard in the format of a report.
    The report must include your conclusions and recommendations to the business, as it’s the main goal of any analysis. Without conclusions and recommendations the final project won’t      get accepted.
    There is no strict format to the report - it may be just a document, a pdf with graphs, or a presentation.

   Feedback:
   
    A lot of white space in the second chart. Change this chart to "entire view" to fill up the empty space. 
    Scatterchart could be a nice addition here to look for outliers with Ratings and High Sales. 
    Would've been better to use the food item versus the item code in "Food AVG Price Sales". 
    Some of the charts are duplicative between "What affects sales" and "Average Order value.." tab. 
    Would be helpful to have legend in "Cities X Cusines X Sales" chart at the end.
